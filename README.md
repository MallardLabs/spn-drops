# spn-drops

Physical real-time simulation of transactions on the Superposition mainnet network.

This project is a fork of [sonic-drops](https://github.com/paintoshi/sonic-drops).  
The original project is licensed under the MIT License and copyright (c) 2024 Paintoshi.  
This fork includes updated styling and migration from Sonic to Superposition by [Mallard Labs](https://github.com/mallardlabs) in 2025.

## How does it work?

Transactions are recorded live from the Superposition network using a public RPC.
Ball size and color coresponds to the transaction amount.
Click on the spheres to see the transaction details.


Conduit Blue: 0 ETH

Less Blue: 0 - 1 ETH

Even less Blue: 1 - 1,000 ETH

White with a tinge of blue: 1,000 - 100,000 ETH

White: > 100,000 ETH


Note: Will be updated to SPN when $SPN is live!
